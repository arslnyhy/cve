    This rule checks for the CVE-2024-20381 vulnerability, which affects devices
    with the JSON-RPC API feature enabled in ConfD. The vulnerability allows an
    authenticated, remote attacker to modify the configuration of an affected
    application or device due to improper authorization checks.

    The test inspects the 'confd.conf' configuration file to see if the 'webui'
    feature is enabled. If enabled, it indicates that the JSON-RPC API is active,
    making the device susceptible to this vulnerability.
